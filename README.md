# Cryptography Labs in Python 🛡️🔐
Basic cryptography exercises in Python (Caesar, RSA)

This repository contains some of my first steps into **cybersecurity and cryptography**.  
I am a second-year Computer Science student and joined a cybersecurity interest group where I started exploring basic encryption and decryption concepts.  

These are simple labs, but they represent the foundation of my journey in learning how data can be secured.

## 📂 Projects

### 1. Caesar Cipher
- A classic substitution cipher that shifts letters of the alphabet by a key value.
- The script takes a message and a key as input, then outputs the encrypted version.
- Handles uppercase, lowercase, spaces, and other characters.

**Example:**
Input:
Hello World
3

Output:
Khoor Zruog 

### 2. RSA Decryption 
- Demonstrates how RSA decryption works using the formula: plaintext = (ciphertext ^ d) mod n
- The script takes values for n, e, d, and ciphertext as input, then outputs the decrypted plaintext.

**Example:**
Input:
n = 3233
e = 17
d = 2753
ciphertext = 855

Output:
123
